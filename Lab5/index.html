                    <p>
                        In the fall of 2011, Adam Disbrow stumbled upon the technological world.
                        He discovered that while many of the mobile phone repair stores at that time made fairly good repairs, the reception of their customers was extremely poor. Disappointed, he decided that he would create his own repair brand. A brand that would surpass all the other gadget repair stores in Chattanooga. Out of the need for better, The Cell Surgeon was born. Adam smartly capitalized on the deficiencies of other repair stores and worked out two objectives:
                        
                        "To create the best gadget repair brand in the world"
                        
                        "To do it without ever losing the smile on his face.""
                        
                        Even today, The Cell Surgeon remains true to the objectives for which it was created.
